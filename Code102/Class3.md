1. What is Version Control?

- A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to track changes to a file and saves different versions of said file.  This allows you to easily view changes between versions and to revert to a different version if need be.

  #### Local Version Control

  - A database on a hard disk that stores changes to files.

  #### Centralized Version Control
  
  - A single server storing changes and file versions which can be accessed by multiple clients.This eliminated the need for storage on all local databases and allowed for a much easier collaboration process / divvying up of tasks.

  #### Distributed Version Control
  
  - Similar to a CVCS except that it uses mirrored repositories, which allows for back up data.  This improves upon the CVCS by eliminating the server as a single point of failure.  This also allows for even more flexibility in working on simultaneous tasks (as long as it's correctly cooordinated).
