# Github and Markdown
## Github Pages

You can use markdown language to create and format Github pages in a repo without using HTML.

## Markdown and its Syntax

There are a number of of applications with deviations from the standard Markdown syntax but nearly all of them still utilize the original Markdown documentation.  You can use simple characters to format and organize your document with headers, line breaks, lists, hyperlinks, and more.

- Headers: '#'
- Lists: '-', '*', or '1.'
- Block quotations: '>'
- Links: '\[Title]\(Web Address)'
- Line Breaks: '\<br>\'
