# Wireframes and HTML
## Wireframes

- Wireframing is the practice of creating the layout of your website/application.  

- Whether it's with pen and paper or a software application, this allows the designer to consider how they want users to view and interact with the app, and gives them a chance to think about how certain features will be displayed, as well as a rough template to follow before starting on actual code.

### Steps to Wireframing

1. Do Your Research:

    - Before you wireframe, you should be researching your target audience.  Who is this product for?  Define use cases for potential users.  Would the product you're designing satisfy those use cases?
    - In the same vein, you should be researching products similar to yours in the industry. Not only to understand the competition you're facing, but to take a look at their UX as well.  Understand why they designed their features the way they did.  How did their design facilitate your use of their application, and what would you do differently, and why?
    - Also don't be afraid to research outside of your scope (within reason).  The intersection between ideas and applications can sometimes lead to interesting innovations or concepts.

2. Prepare Research for Quick Reference:

    - Keep a compilation of the best features and target audience data that you found during your research

3. Make Sure You Have Your User Flow Mapped Out:

    - Figure out how many different pages you plan to have for this application
    - Also try to envision where users may be coming from on each page and where you logically want them to progress to. Study "user flows."

4. Draft, Don’t Draw. Sketch, Don’t Illustrate:
    
    - Keep things simple initially; don't worry about stuff like specific colors or fonts
    - Think about things like, "What should the user see first?", or "How can I organize content to fulfill user stories?"
    - Create the blocks that structure the skeleton of your application

5. Add Some Detail and Test:
    
    - At this point add things like navigation buttons and get some tooltips for some of the features so it's more clear what's going where.
    - Ask peers to review the wireframe and give you some input

6. Turn Your Wireframe Into a Prototype:
    
    - Document and implement any feedback from the last step.
    - Port it over to a software application like Invision at this point and begin adding more details and stringing pages together to get a prototype going (if needed)

### Things to Remember for Wireframes

1. Clarity: The wireframe needs to be able to tell people what the site is, what users are able to do there, and if it fulfills the user stories associated with them.

2. Confidence: Is it easy to navigate and does the design show intuitive placement for things like buttons?

3. Simplicity: Viewers shouldn't be overloaded with too much information or links.  The site should accomplish its goals without adding unecessary elements.

## HTML

1. What is HTML and why do we use it?

    - HyperText Markup Language: HTML is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.  It achieves this by using elements.

2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

    - Opening tag, content, and the closing tag.

3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?

    - Attributes may be assigned to elements to alter them or provide additional info/functionality.

4. What is a semantic element?

    - Semantics in coding refers to the meaning of the code.  I.e., "What is this code doing?"  
    - `h1` would be a semantic element because it's an element that tells us that the content inside will be a level 1 header.
